Welcome to limetta's Hytale API Documentation! We've been working on a Hytale server with our own plugins, and during this we've had to dig through the decompiled HytaleServer to figure out the API. These docs are written based on our findings.

The documentation here is:
- Based on decompiled code from HytaleServer
- Investigated and written by Claude Opus

As with any AI content, please take it with a grain of salt. However, we try to make sure that this documentation can be as accurate and free of hallucinations as possible:

- The *API Reference* section is fully programatically generated from decompiled HytaleServer code without any human or AI involvement.
- All other documentation and guides are fact-checked against this programatically-generated API Reference and made to link to it for correctness.
- We use this documentation ourselves to make our own plugins.

If you spot any mistakes, have any feedback, or think something is missing, please feel free to reach out on our [Discord server](https://limetta.dev/discord), in the `#hytale` channel.
